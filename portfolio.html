        <h4> De Medi-bot</h4>

        <p>In CLE1 (Sprint 1), I got the assignment to create a robot that would make my groupmate's life better.
          My groupmate has ADHD and has to take her medication every day. But sometimes she forgets to take the
          medecine and as a result she cannot concentrate. With the Circuit Playground
          and Crickit I had made a timer robot that she can also play with.</p>

        <h4> Hah or Nah</h4>

        <p> In CLE1 (Sprint 2) we had to work in groups. We first had to choose a robot from Sprint 1 and expand on it.
          We had chosen the "Judging Giraffe" by Eline Kers, one of my groupmates.
          If you tell the robot a joke and then shake it, the robot judges your joke.
          We had given the robot multiple functionalities. Pressing button A makes the robot change modes.
          When you hug the robot, the robot gets happy and starts to make a nice song for you.
          Because this is a prototype the casing is made of wood. </p>

        <h4> Gary The Jokebot</h4>

        <p> In CLE1 (Sprint 3) we had branch out what we madein sprint 2. We each made sketches
          of what we wanted the robot to look like then picked something from each design. We decided to
          keep the joke judging function, which is in de Circuit Playground in the eye. We put a hugging
          function in a circuit playground in the chest.(It plays a song in the chest). And in a seperate circuit
          playground theres a timer that that goes of if the plushie is not interacted with for over 5 mins.
